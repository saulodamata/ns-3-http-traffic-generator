/**

 *
 * This is the client side of a HTTP Traffic Generator. The client
 * establishes a TCP connection with the server and sends a request
 * for the main object of a given web page. When client gets the main
 * object, it process the message and start to request the inline objects
 * of the given web page. After receiving all inline objects, the client
 * waits an interval (reading time) before it requests a new main object
 * of a new web page. The implementation of this application is simplistic
 * and it does not support pipelining in this current version. The
 * model used is based on the distributions indicated in the paper
 * "An HTTP Web Traffic Model Based on the Top One Million Visited
 * Web Pages" by Rastin Pries et. al. This simplistic approach was
 * taken since this traffic generator was developed primarily to help
 * users evaluate their proposed algorithm in other modules of NS-3.
 * To allow deeper studies about the HTTP Protocol it needs some improvements.
