 * This is the server side of a HTTP Traffic Generator. The server
 * establishes a TCP connection with the client and waits for the
 * object requests. The implementation of this application is simplistic
 * and it does not support pipelining in this current version. The
 * model used is based on the distributions indicated in the paper
 * "An HTTP Web Traffic Model Based on the Top One Million Visited
 * Web Pages" by Rastin Pries et. al. This simplistic approach was
 * taken since this traffic generator was developed primarily to help
 * users evaluate their proposed algorithm in other modules of NS-3.
 * To allow deeper studies about the HTTP Protocol it needs some improvements.
